    <h2><a href="jptranscription-project.html">Japanese Transcription</a></h2>
    This page is dedicated to showcase the <b>projects</b> I'm working on. My latest project is called 
    <a href="https://github.com/schmxtz/jptranscription">jptranscription</a>. <br><br> 
    It uses the international phonetic alphabet to
    transcribe German words into Japanese characters (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana#Writing_system">Katakana</a>). This way native Japanese are able to read German text somewhat close to
    what it would sound like if they knew German. It uses a custom lookup-table that I made to map from phonetic blocks to their Katakana representation.<br><br>
    I made an API that uses this library and a tokenizer to transcribe each word into either its IPA or Katakana representation. On <a href="jptranscription-project.html">this</a> page I explained my progress.
    <br><br>
    I also added a translation feature, because friends told me it would make more sense to directly incorporate that too.

    <h2>Voxel shooter with "realistic" body-parts</h2>
    My next endeavor will be to create a shooter with the <a href="https://bevyengine.org/"> BEVY engine</a> in Rust. I'm passionate about video games and have
    always dreamed of making my own game with my own ideas and rules. And Rust has fascinated me recently, so this will be a great way to learn the language
    and its intricacies.
