    <h2>Introduction</h2>
   The idea behind this project started when I was learning Japanese. I realized that the pronunciation of Japanese is very similar to German in some ways. Or
   at least you can "recreate" German words using Japanese Katakana.<br>
   
   My first thought then, was to split German words into their syllables and then have a mapping
   to transcribe each mapping to its Japanese counterpart. However according to <a href="https://german.stackexchange.com/questions/70223/how-many-different-syllables-does-the-german-language-have">this</a> post,
   there are around 140000 unique syllables in German - there has to be a better way.<br>
   So then thinking like a mathematician, I first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_(mathematics)">reduced</a> the problem to a smaller subset. The way I achieved this, was to first get the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">phonetic representation</a> of
   each word and then create a mapping for phonetic blocks to Katakana blocks. This surprisingly worked as there are only around 600 entries in my mapping so far.

    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    The first issue I ran into was, how do I get the phonetic representation of all German words. And is it possible to find something that is free to use and open-source?<br>
